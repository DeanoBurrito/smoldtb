# Smol DTB API

The API is split into three main groups of functions:
- `dtb_find_*` functions are for quickly locating a node or property by some characteristic.
- `dtb_get_*` are for manually traversing the tree.
- `dtb_read_*` functions can be used to extra data from properties.

While the device tree specification (v0.4 at the time of writing) uses big-endian integers, the API for smoldtb uses the native endianness of the machine it was compiled for. It will handle the conversion to big-endian internally (if necessary).

## Find functions

`dtb_node* dtb_find_compatible(dtb_node* node, const char* str)`: Linearly searches the tree for any nodes with a 'compatible' property that matches this string. Since this property can contain multiple strings, all of them are checked for a given input. The first argument is where to start the search and can be `NULL` to begin at the root of the tree. If a compatible node has been found previously, that node can be used as the starting location for the search and this function will return the *next node* that matches. In the event no nodes have this compatible string, `NULL` is returned.

`dtb_node* dtb_find_phandle(unsigned handle)`: Looks up which node is associated with a given phandle and returns it. If the phandle is unused, `NULL` is returned.

`dtb_node* dtb_find(const char* path)`: Attempts to find a node based on the path provided. The path is a series of unit names (the trailing address part can be exempt) separated by a forward slash `/`, similar to a unix filepath. Returns `NULL` if the node couldn't be located. Properties cannot be looked up this way, you must look up the node and then use `dtb_get_prop()`.

`dtb_prop* dtb_find_prop(dtb_node* node, const char* name)`: Returns a property of this node with the matching name, or `NULL` if a property isn't found.

`dtb_node* dtb_find_child(dtb_node* node, const char* name)`: Attempts to find a child of a node with a matching unit name (unit address is exempt from the string comparison). Returns `NULL` if no matching child is present.

## Get functions

`dtb_node* dtb_get_sibling(dtb_node* node)`: Returns this node's sibling (the next child of this node's parent). Note that a node will always have the same sibling. To traverse the tree horizontally this function should be called on the node returned by an earlier `dtb_get_sibling()` call. If a node has no sibling, `NULL` is returned.

`dtb_node* dtb_get_child(dtb_node* node)`: Returns the first child of this node. Subsequent calls to this function will always return the same node, `dtb_get_sibling()` should be called on the child node to get further child nodes. Returns `NULL` if node has no children.

`dtb_node* dtb_get_parent(dtb_node* node)`: Returns this nodes parent node, or `NULL` if node is at the root level.

`dtb_prop* dtb_get_prop(dtb_node* node, size_t index)`: Returns the property with this index. While properties aren't stored this way, it can be useful for exploring a node's properties. If an index is beyond the number of properties a node has, `NULL` is returned.

`void dtb_stat_node(dtb_node* node, dtb_node_stat* stat)`: Requires `stat` to be a pointer to a pre-allocated struct, and will provide info about `node` in `stat` such as the node's name, number of children and number of properties.

## Read Functions

`const char* dtb_read_string(dtb_prop* prop, size_t index)`: String-based properties can contain multiple null-terminated strings, `index` selects which string you want to read. If the index is out of bounds `NULL` is returned, otherwise a pointer to the ASCII-encoded text (as per the Device Tree v0.4 spec) is returned.

`size_t dtb_read_prop_values(dtb_prop* prop, size_t cell_count size_t* vals)`: The `cell_count` argument determines how many cells comprise a single value. This value is specific to the property you're trying to read and you should consult the spec about what to set this to. This function returns the number of values this property would contain for the given `cell_count`. If `vals` is non-null, this function will treat it as an array to write the values into. To use this function it's recommended to call it once with `vals = NULL` to determine how many values are present, then allocate space for the values, and then call the function again with `vals = your_buffer`.

`size_t dtb_read_prop_pairs(dtb_prop* prop, dtb_pair layout, dtb_pair* vals)`: This function is similar to `dtb_read_values()` except it reads pairs of values. The `layout` argument replaces the `cell_count` argument of the previous function: `layout.a` is the number of cells for the first element of the value and `layout.b` is the cell count for second element. As above, if `vals` is non-null it is treated as an array to read the pairs of values into.

`size_t dtb_read_prop_triplets(dtb_prop* prop, dtb_triplet layout, dtb_triplets* vals)`: This function is similar to `dtb_read_pairs()` except that it operates on three-element values.

`size_t dtb_read_prop_quads(dtb_prop* prop, dtb_quad layout, dtb_quad* vals)`: Again this function is similar to the above ones, except it operates on 4-element values.
